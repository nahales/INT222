          <h3>CSS3 Animations</h3>
          <section class="entry-content">
			<p>	An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want. To use CSS3 animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.</p>
			<h4>The @keyframes Rule</h4>
			<p>When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times. To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.</p>
			<p>The following example binds the "example" animation to the &lt;div&gt; element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the &lt;div&gt; element from "red" to "yellow":</p>
			<h4>Example:</h4>
			<p>/* The animation code */<br/>
				@keyframes example {<br/>
					from {background-color: red;}<br/>
					to {background-color: yellow;}<br/>
				}<br/>

				/* The element to apply the animation to */<br/>
				div {<br/>
					width: 100px;<br/>
					height: 100px;<br/>
					background-color: red;<br/>
					animation-name: example;<br/>
					animation-duration: 4s;<br/>
				}<br/>
			</p>
			<p>Note: If the animation-duration property is not specified, the animation will have no effect, because the default value is 0.<br/>
			In the example above we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords "from" and "to" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)). It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.<br/>

          <h3 class="entry-header">CSS3 Positioning</h3>
          <section class="entry-content">
			<p>Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different position values, and how to use them.</p>
			<p>The whole idea of positioning is to allow us to override the basic document flow behaviour to produce interesting effects. What if you want to slightly alter the position of some boxes inside a layout from their default layout flow position, to give a slightly quirky, distressed feel? Positioning is your tool. Or if you want to create a UI element that floats over the top of other parts of the page, and/or always sits in the same place inside the browser window no matter how much the page is scrolled? Positioning makes such layout work possible.</p>
			<p>There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put into effect on HTML elements. To make a specific type of positioning active on an element, we use the position property.</p>
			<h4>Static Positioning</h4>
			<p>Static positioning is the default that every element gets — it just means "put the element into it's normal position in the document layout flow".</p>
			<h4>Relative Positioning</h4>
			<p>Relative positioning is the first position type we'll take a look at. This is very similar to static positioning, except that once the positioned element has taken its place in the normal layout flow, you can then modify its final position, including making it overlap other elements on the page.<br/>
			</p>
			<h4>Other Types of Positioning</h4>
			<p>There are other types of positioning as well, such as Absolute positioning, Fixed positioning,...etc. For more information, you can visit the reference website. <br/>

          <h3 class="entry-header">HTML &lt;iframe&gt; Tag</h3>
          <section class="entry-content">
			<p>	The HTML Inline Frame Element (iframe) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. In HTML 4.01, a document may contain a head and a body or a head and a frameset, but not both a body and a frameset. However, an &lt;iframe&gt; can be used within a normal document body. Each browsing context has its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the embedded content is called the parent browsing context. The top-level browsing context (which has no parent) is typically the browser window.</p>
			<h4>Scripting</h4>
			<p>Inline frames, like &lt;frame&gt; elements, enter the window.frames pseudo-array.<br/>
				From the DOM iframe element, scripts can get access to the window object of the included HTML page via the contentWindow property. The contentDocument property refers to the document element inside the iframe (this is equivalent to contentWindow.document), but is not supported by Internet Explorer versions before IE8.</p>
			<p>From the inside of a frame, a script can get a reference to the parent window via Window.parent.</p>
			<p>Scripts trying to access a frame's content are subject to the same-origin policy, and cannot access most of the properties in the other window object if it was loaded from a different domain. This also applies to a script inside a frame trying to access its parent window. Cross-domain communication can still be achieved with Window.postMessage().</p>
			<h4>A simple &lt;iframe&gt;</h4>
			<p>This is a basic example of an &lt;iframe&gt; in action. After creating the frame, when the user clicks a button, its title is retrieved and displayed in an alert.</p>
			<p>&lt;iframe src="https://mdn-samples.mozilla.org/snippets/html/iframe-simple-contents.html" width="400" height="300"&gt;<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
				&lt;/frame&gt;</P>
